	     Truth Table Generator by Palladinos Nick

This program creates truth tables from boolean expressions.
I believe that it's very useful for Computer science 
students who learning Boolean algebra and predicate logic (like my self).
It's very simple to use it. First you enter the expressions
and the program analyse them and extracts the variables. 
Then it creates the whole range of values in order
to create the table. Each expression is evaluating with the 
new values.
In this version I have implement the following operations:
* AND
+ OR
~ NOT 
You can use both variables and (1 , 0)
Look at the following examples:
P * q
~(p + q)
~p * ~q
~0 * ~(p * q + 1)
0 + 1 * (BAD * good)

If you like it and you found something useful,
please vote for my effort.
